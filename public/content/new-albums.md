It's a bit of a slow week this week it seems, but here are a couple of new releases I'm checking out the week of September 20, 2024:

* **[Talker by Wilderado](https://listentomore.com/album/wilderado_talker)**. Second album from the indie folk / alternative band.
* **[CHLORINE by Justin Nozuka](https://listentomore.com/album/justin-nozuka_chlorine).** I remember being obsessed with the gentle R&B vibes of his album [Holly](https://listentomore.com/album/justin-nozuka_holly) way back in the day (2008!) but haven't really kept up.
