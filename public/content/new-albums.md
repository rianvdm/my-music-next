Here are the releases I'm checking out the week of October 18, 2024:

- **[Tell My Therapist I'm Fine by Bishop Briggs](https://listentomore.com/album/bishop-briggs_tell-my-therapist-im-fine)**. Some good ol' pop-rock to start the weekend right.
- **[Memory Of A Day by Phantogram](https://listentomore.com/album/phantogram_memory-of-a-day)**. I always have time for a new album from the electronica / trip-hop duo.
- **[In The Real World by Eric Bibb](https://listentomore.com/album/eric-bibb_in-the-real-world)**. One of my favorite Blues guitarists. If you like Keb' Mo' or Buddy Guy, you'll probably love this.
