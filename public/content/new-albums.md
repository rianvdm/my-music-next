Happy Friday! Here's what I'm checking out the week of September 27, 2024:

* **[Letters by Tiphanie Doucet](https://listentomore.com/album/tiphanie-doucet_letters)**. Lovely blend of folk and indie pop from this French-American singer-songwriter. Try it if you like Feist and Norah Jones.
* **[Revelation by Leif Vollebekk](https://listentomore.com/album/leif-vollebekk_revelation)**. More chill indie folk vibes. I got to know him through [Twin Solitude](https://listentomore.com/album/leif-vollebekk_twin-solitude), definitely check that one out too.
* **[Live From Wrigley Field by The Lumineers](https://listentomore.com/album/the-lumineers_live-from-wrigley-field)**. I'm a sucker for live albums ðŸ¤·.
* **[FOREVER! Best Of 40 Years by Alphaville](https://listentomore.com/album/alphaville_forever!-best-of-40-years)**. Sorrynotsorry? Always fun dipping back into these songs. I'm not sure they 40 songs worth listening to, but I am determined to find out...
