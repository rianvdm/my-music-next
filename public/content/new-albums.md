It's a good week for new releases! Here's what I'm checking out the week of October 4, 2024:

* **[Leon by Leon Bridges](https://listentomore.com/album/leon-bridges_leon)**. I've been really looking forward to the new one from the neo-soul master.
* **[The Last Flight by Public Service Broadcasting](https://listentomore.com/album/public-service-broadcasting_the-last-flight)**. I absolutely adore [The Race for Space](https://listentomore.com/album/public-service-broadcasting_the-race-for-space), an album that uses old public radio broadcast recordings to recreate the space race of the 60s. This latest one is "a concept album dedicated to the mysterious disappearance of Amelia Earhart during her attempted circumnavigation of the globe in 1937." Love it.
* **[Cutouts by The Smile](https://listentomore.com/album/the-smile_cutouts)**. Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood's second album of 2024? Yes please.
* **[Honey by Caribou](https://listentomore.com/album/caribou_honey)**. Always up for checking out some weird indie dance. 
* **[Moon Music by Coldplay](https://listentomore.com/album/coldplay_moon-music)**. I mean, ok. But listen, I am contractually obligated to listen to each new Coldplay album at least once. Don't @ me.
