This week I'm mostly checking out:

* **[Luck and Strange by David Gilmour](https://listentomore.com/album/david-gilmour_luck-and-strange)**. I'm a long-time Pink Floyd / David Gilmour fan, but I'll confess his solo albums have mostly left me cold. Not this one, though! Really enjoying it.
* **[ten days by Fred again..](https://listentomore.com/album/fred-again.._ten-days)**. I'm a newcomer to Fred Again.., but I spent a lot of time with 2023's [Secret Life](https://listentomore.com/album/fred-again.._secret-life). This new album has a lot of wonderful collaborations on it, including with [Skrillex](https://listentomore.com/artist/skrillex), and [Japanese House](https://listentomore.com/artist/the-japanese-house)!
* For the ambient fans, also check out **[Ritual by Jon Hopkins](https://listentomore.com/album/jon-hopkins_ritual)**. Jon Hopkins is mostly known for his harder electronic stuff, but he made a solid drone album here. It's been on high rotation.
