Here are some new releases I'm checking out the week of September 14, 2024:

* **[Live Drugs Again by The War On Drugs](https://listentomore.com/album/the-war-on-drugs_live-drugs-again)**. I really loved the first Live Drugs, so I'm hopeful about this one!
* **[The Forest Is The Path by Snow Patrol](https://listentomore.com/album/snow-patrol_the-forest-is-the-path)**. A new Snow Patrol in 2024? Ok fine I'll take it. I've listened to this one a bit and it's mellow and lovely so far.
* **[Dayglow by Dayglow](https://listentomore.com/album/dayglow_dayglow)**. Some light indie pop fun for good weekend times.
