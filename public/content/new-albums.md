It's a bit of a slow week this week it seems, but here are a couple of new releases I'm checking out the week of September 20, 2024:

* **[In Waves by Jamie xx](https://listentomore.com/album/jamie-xx_in-waves)**. First solo album in 9 years! Looking forward to this one. "The album is characterized by its maximalist approach, featuring a plethora of samples from Jamie's extensive vinyl collection, which he drew upon during the lockdown period."
* **[Talker by Wilderado](https://listentomore.com/album/wilderado_talker)**. Second album from the indie folk / alternative band.
* **[CHLORINE by Justin Nozuka](https://listentomore.com/album/justin-nozuka_chlorine).** I remember being obsessed with the gentle R&B vibes of his album [Holly](https://listentomore.com/album/justin-nozuka_holly) way back in the day (2008!) but haven't really kept up.
