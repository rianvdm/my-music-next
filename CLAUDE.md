1. Open TODO.md and identify any prompts not marked as completed.
2. For each incomplete prompt:
   - Double-check if it's truly unfinished (if uncertain, ask for clarification).
   - If you confirm it's already done, skip it.
   - Otherwise, implement it as described. Before starting implementation, provide an ELI5 explanation of what you're about to do
   - Make sure the tests pass, and the program builds/runs
   - Commit the changes to your repository with a clear commit message.
   - Update @todo.md to mark this prompt as completed.
3. After you finish each prompt, explain what you did and what should now be possible. If I am able to manually test the latest change myself to make sure it works, give me instructions on how I can do that.
4. Pause and wait for user review or feedback.
5. Repeat with the next unfinished prompt as directed by the user.
