### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Rian van der Merwe](https://elezea.com/) and this is a side project about the music I listen to. It pulls data from [my Last.fm activity](https://www.last.fm/user/bordesak) and then I _do stuff_ with it. It's a work in progress.

The site is built on [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) products, including [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), and [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/). It's great--and I'm not just saying that because [I work there](https://elezea.com/portfolio/).
