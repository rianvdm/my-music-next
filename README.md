### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Rian van der Merwe](https://elezea.com/) and this site started as a side project about the music I listen to, but then I got obsessed with it and now it's a whole lot more. It pulls data from [my Last.fm activity](https://www.last.fm/user/bordesak) and [Discogs collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/elezea-records/collection), and then I âœ¨enhanceâœ¨ the data using the APIs for Spotify, ChatGPT, and Perplexity. So have fun. Use the site to find information about an artist or album, and find your next favorite listen.

The site is built on [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) products, including [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), and [Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/workers-kv/). It's a wonderful set of tools to work with--and I'm not just saying that because [I work there](https://elezea.com/portfolio/).

If you want to chat about this project, feel free to [reach out](https://elezea.com/contact/)! And if you spot any bugs (there are lots!) or have any ideas for things to add, please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rianvdm/my-music-next/issues).

PS I also have a Beta of a Discord Bot that lets you get streaming links for albums. It looks like this:

If you'd like to test it out, let me know!
