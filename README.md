## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Rian van der Merwe](https://elezea.com/) and this site started as a side project about the music I listen to, but then I got obsessed with it and now it's **an ever-expanding album and artist database that helps you find wonderful things to listen to.** Look around, do some searching, and (hopefully) find your next favorite album.

## Discord Bot

If you are part of a Discord server where you share music with each other, the companion Discord Bot lets you easily generate streaming links (and other information) for albums. You can **[add it to your server here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1284593290947068024)**.

### List of commands:

| Command        | Description                                                                                                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/listento`    | Enter an album and artist, get streaming links for all platforms as well as a link to more details about the album. |
| `/listenurl`   | The same as `/listento`, but enter a streaming URL from any platform (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.).                 |
| `/listenlast`  | Enter your Last.fm username, get the same details for the last album you listened to.       |
| `/whois`       | One-sentence summary of an artist.                                                                      |
| `/whatis`      | Two-sentence summary of a musical genre, with a link to history, artists, and albums to check out. |
| `/ask`		 | An excuse to play with prompting and open-source AI models, this is gives you short answers to your most pressing questions, using HAL 9000 as the personality. |


As an example, the `/listento`, `listenurl`, and `/listenlast` commands show details like this:

## Nerdy details

The site uses APIs from Last.fm, Spotify, OpenAI, and Perplexity to get album and artist data, and generate some interesting facts about it all. It is built on [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) products, including [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), [Workers AI](https://ai.cloudflare.com/), and [Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/workers-kv/). It's a wonderful set of tools to work withâ€”and I'm not just saying that because [I work there](https://elezea.com/portfolio/).

If you want to chat about this project, feel free to [reach out](https://elezea.com/contact/)! And if you spot any bugs (there are lots!) or have any ideas for things to add, please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rianvdm/my-music-next/issues).
