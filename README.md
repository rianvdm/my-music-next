## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Rian van der Merwe](https://elezea.com/) and this site started as a side project about the music I listen to, but then I got obsessed with it and now it's a whole lot more. It uses Last.fm, Spotify, OpenAI, and Perplexity to create an album and artist database that exists to help you find wonderful things to listen to. Do some searching, click around, and **find your next favorite listen**.

## Discord Bot {#discord-bot}

If you are part of a Discord server where you share music with each other, the companion Discord Bot lets you easily generate streaming links (and other information) for albums. You can [add it to your server here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1284593290947068024).

### Current commands:

| Command        | Description                                                                                                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/listento`    | Enter an album and artist, get streaming links for all platforms as well as a link to more details about the album. |
| `/listenurl`   | The same as `/listento`, but enter a streaming URL from any platform (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.).                 |
| `/listenlast`   | Enter your Last.fm username, get the same details for the last album you listened to.       |
| `/whois`       | One-sentence summary of an artist.                                                                      |


As an example, the `/listento`, `listenurl`, and `/listenlast` commands show details like this:

The site is built on [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) products, including [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), and [Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/workers-kv/). It's a wonderful set of tools to work withâ€”and I'm not just saying that because [I work there](https://elezea.com/portfolio/).
