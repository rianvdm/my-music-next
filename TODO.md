# Production Readiness TODO

This checklist tracks the production readiness improvements for Listen To More.

## üö® CRITICAL: Testing Coverage for Safe Refactoring (Significantly improved!)

### MUST DO BEFORE ANY MAJOR REFACTORING:

1. **Critical Page Tests** (Major progress: 3/4 critical pages complete)

   - [x] ~~Test main page (`app/page.js`) - Contains core functionality with 16 passing tests~~
   - [x] ~~Test collection page (`app/collection/page.js`) - Complex data visualization with 24 passing tests~~
   - [x] ~~Test library page (`app/library/page.js`) - Data management functionality with 31 passing tests~~
   - [ ] Test album/artist dynamic pages - Core navigation flows

2. **Custom Hooks Testing** (Currently 0% coverage)

   - [ ] Extract and test `useRandomFact` hook
   - [ ] Extract and test `useRandomGenre` hook
   - [ ] Extract and test `useRecentSearches` hook
   - [ ] Test error scenarios for all hooks

3. **Integration Testing** (None exist)

   - [ ] Add tests for page navigation flows
   - [ ] Test data fetching and loading states
   - [ ] Test error handling paths
   - [ ] Mock all external API calls

4. **E2E Testing Setup**
   - [ ] Set up Playwright for E2E tests
   - [ ] Test critical user journey: Search ‚Üí Album ‚Üí Artist
   - [ ] Test collection filtering and sorting
   - [ ] Test form submissions and validations

## ‚úÖ Critical Missing Elements - COMPLETED

### 1. Testing Infrastructure (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ

- [x] ~~No tests found - This is the biggest production readiness gap~~
- [x] ~~Add Jest + React Testing Library~~
- [x] ~~Implement unit tests for components and utilities~~
- [x] ~~Add integration tests for API routes~~
- [ ] ~~Set up E2E testing with Playwright or Cypress~~ (Moved to CRITICAL section above)

### 2. Code Quality Tools (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ

- [x] ~~Missing ESLint configuration - Add .eslintrc.js with Next.js rules~~
- [x] ~~No Prettier - Add code formatting standards~~
- [ ] No TypeScript - Consider migrating for better type safety
- [x] ~~Add pre-commit hooks with Husky + lint-staged~~

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ

- [x] ~~No GitHub Actions - Add automated workflows for:~~
  - [x] ~~Linting and testing on PRs~~
  - [x] ~~Build verification~~
  - [x] ~~Automated deployment validation~~
  - [x] ~~Security scanning~~

## üîÑ Code Architecture Issues - IN PROGRESS

### 4. Component Structure

- [ ] Components mixed in /app/components/ - move to dedicated /components/ or /src/components/
- [ ] Large monolithic components (especially app/page.js:204) - break into smaller, focused components
- [ ] Inconsistent component patterns - some use hooks, others don't

### 5. Error Handling & Loading States

- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries and fallback UI
- [ ] Improve error handling beyond basic try-catch
- [ ] Add consistent loading states across components

### 6. Performance Issues

- [ ] No memoization in components with expensive operations
- [ ] Missing React.memo for pure components
- [ ] No lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] API calls on every render without proper caching

## üîê Security & Configuration - PENDING

### 7. Environment Management

- [ ] API endpoints hardcoded (e.g., https://kv-fetch-random-fact.rian-db8.workers.dev/)
- [ ] Missing environment validation
- [ ] No secrets management strategy

### 8. Security Headers

- [ ] Add security headers in next.config.mjs
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API routes

## üìÖ Implementation Timeline

### ‚úÖ Immediate Actions (Week 1) - COMPLETED

1. [x] ~~Add basic testing setup (Jest + React Testing Library)~~
2. [x] ~~Add ESLint + Prettier~~
3. [x] ~~Create GitHub Actions workflow for basic CI~~

### üîÑ Short-term improvements (Month 1) - IN PROGRESS

4. [ ] Component refactoring:
   - [ ] Extract custom hooks to /hooks/ directory
   - [ ] Split large components into smaller ones
   - [ ] Add proper PropTypes or migrate to TypeScript
5. [ ] Error handling:
   - [ ] Add React Error Boundaries
   - [ ] Implement proper loading states
   - [ ] Add fallback UI components
6. [ ] Performance optimization:
   - [ ] Add React.memo where appropriate
   - [ ] Implement proper data fetching patterns
   - [ ] Add caching strategy

### üìã Medium-term goals (Month 2-3) - PLANNED

7. [ ] TypeScript migration for better type safety
8. [ ] Add proper state management (if app grows)
9. [ ] Implement monitoring and error tracking
10. [ ] Add accessibility improvements

## üìÅ Recommended File Structure

```
/src
  /components
    /ui (reusable UI components)
    /features (feature-specific components)
  /hooks (custom React hooks)
  /utils (utilities and helpers)
  /types (TypeScript definitions)
  /constants
/tests
  /components
  /utils
  /integration
/.github/workflows
```

## üéØ Current Status

**‚úÖ MAJOR WINS:**

- Testing infrastructure with 71 passing tests
- ESLint + Prettier code quality tools
- Complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Security scanning and dependency checks (fixed and working)
- Post-deployment validation workflow
- **SECURITY UPDATES:**
  - Next.js updated to 15.3.3 (resolves critical vulnerabilities)
  - Fixed GitHub Actions security workflows
  - Dependency vulnerabilities patched

**üîÑ NEXT PRIORITIES:**

1. **CRITICAL**: Complete testing coverage for safe refactoring (see section above)
2. Component refactoring and code organization (AFTER testing)
3. Enhanced error handling and loading states
4. Performance optimizations
5. TypeScript migration planning

**üìä Security Status: ‚úÖ SECURE**

- Critical Next.js vulnerabilities resolved
- Dependency scanning active and non-blocking
- Secret scanning configured properly
- All workflows passing
