## üîÑ NEXT PRIORITIES: Code Architecture & Organization

### 4. Component Structure Refactoring ‚úÖ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**

**Status: PHASE 1 COMPLETE - Major improvements implemented**

- [x] **File Organization**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Moved components to organized `/components/` directory structure
  - [x] `/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components (filters, navigation, images)
  - [x] `/components/features/` - Feature-specific components (collection, library, search, home)
  - [x] `/components/layout/` - Layout components (navigation)
  - [x] `/components/charts/` - Chart components (lazy-loaded)
- [x] **Component Splitting**: ‚úÖ MAJOR PROGRESS - Main page split into focused components
  - [x] Split main page component (reduced from 147 to 34 lines - 77% reduction)
  - [x] Extracted 4 home page components: DayGreeting, AlbumSearch, RecentSearches, WelcomeSection
  - [x] **FilterDropdown**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Unified filter component replaces 12 instances across 3 pages
  - [x] **Button Standardization**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Enhanced Button component with variants, replaced 12+ inconsistent implementations
  - [ ] **NEXT**: Extract additional reusable UI components (input fields, loading states)
- [x] **Hook Organization**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Custom hooks organized in `/hooks/` directory
- [x] **Import Path Updates**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - All import paths updated, tests maintained (166 passing)

**üéØ PHASE 1 RESULTS:**

- **12 components** moved to organized structure
- **Main page complexity** reduced by 77%
- **All 181 tests** remain passing
- **Zero breaking changes** - seamless refactoring

### 5. Error Handling & Loading States

**Status: MEDIUM PRIORITY**

- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: Add React Error Boundaries for graceful failure handling
- [ ] **Loading States**: Implement consistent loading UI patterns across components
- [ ] **Fallback UI**: Create fallback components for error scenarios
- [ ] **Error Logging**: Add proper error tracking and logging

### 6. Enhanced User Experience

**Status: MEDIUM PRIORITY**

- [ ] **Navigation Improvements**: Enhance page transitions and loading feedback
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization**: Improve responsive design and touch interactions
- [ ] **PWA Features**: Add offline capability and app-like behavior

---

## üìã FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

### TypeScript Migration

**Status: LONG-TERM GOAL**

- [ ] Gradual migration from JavaScript to TypeScript
- [ ] Add type safety for props, API responses, and state
- [ ] Improve developer experience and catch errors early

### Advanced Performance

**Status: DEFERRED - Already well optimized**

- [x] ~~API Caching Strategy~~ - **SKIPPED**: Already using Workers KV for server-side caching of expensive operations (AI summaries, API responses). Client-side caching would provide minimal additional benefit for the added complexity.

### Security & Configuration

**Status: LOW PRIORITY - Current setup is secure**

- [ ] Environment variable validation
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] API rate limiting (if needed)

### Monitoring & Analytics

**Status: FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**

- [ ] Error tracking and monitoring
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] User analytics and insights
