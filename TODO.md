# Production Readiness TODO

This checklist tracks the production readiness improvements for Listen To More.

## ‚úÖ Critical Missing Elements - COMPLETED

### 1. Testing Infrastructure (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ

- [x] ~~No tests found - This is the biggest production readiness gap~~
- [x] ~~Add Jest + React Testing Library~~
- [x] ~~Implement unit tests for components and utilities~~
- [x] ~~Add integration tests for API routes~~
- [ ] Set up E2E testing with Playwright or Cypress

### 2. Code Quality Tools (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ

- [x] ~~Missing ESLint configuration - Add .eslintrc.js with Next.js rules~~
- [x] ~~No Prettier - Add code formatting standards~~
- [ ] No TypeScript - Consider migrating for better type safety
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks with Husky + lint-staged

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline (HIGH PRIORITY) ‚úÖ

- [x] ~~No GitHub Actions - Add automated workflows for:~~
  - [x] ~~Linting and testing on PRs~~
  - [x] ~~Build verification~~
  - [x] ~~Automated deployment validation~~
  - [x] ~~Security scanning~~

## üîÑ Code Architecture Issues - IN PROGRESS

### 4. Component Structure

- [ ] Components mixed in /app/components/ - move to dedicated /components/ or /src/components/
- [ ] Large monolithic components (especially app/page.js:204) - break into smaller, focused components
- [ ] Inconsistent component patterns - some use hooks, others don't

### 5. Error Handling & Loading States

- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries and fallback UI
- [ ] Improve error handling beyond basic try-catch
- [ ] Add consistent loading states across components

### 6. Performance Issues

- [ ] No memoization in components with expensive operations
- [ ] Missing React.memo for pure components
- [ ] No lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] API calls on every render without proper caching

## üîê Security & Configuration - PENDING

### 7. Environment Management

- [ ] API endpoints hardcoded (e.g., https://kv-fetch-random-fact.rian-db8.workers.dev/)
- [ ] Missing environment validation
- [ ] No secrets management strategy

### 8. Security Headers

- [ ] Add security headers in next.config.mjs
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API routes

## üìÖ Implementation Timeline

### ‚úÖ Immediate Actions (Week 1) - COMPLETED

1. [x] ~~Add basic testing setup (Jest + React Testing Library)~~
2. [x] ~~Add ESLint + Prettier~~
3. [x] ~~Create GitHub Actions workflow for basic CI~~

### üîÑ Short-term improvements (Month 1) - IN PROGRESS

4. [ ] Component refactoring:
   - [ ] Extract custom hooks to /hooks/ directory
   - [ ] Split large components into smaller ones
   - [ ] Add proper PropTypes or migrate to TypeScript
5. [ ] Error handling:
   - [ ] Add React Error Boundaries
   - [ ] Implement proper loading states
   - [ ] Add fallback UI components
6. [ ] Performance optimization:
   - [ ] Add React.memo where appropriate
   - [ ] Implement proper data fetching patterns
   - [ ] Add caching strategy

### üìã Medium-term goals (Month 2-3) - PLANNED

7. [ ] TypeScript migration for better type safety
8. [ ] Add proper state management (if app grows)
9. [ ] Implement monitoring and error tracking
10. [ ] Add accessibility improvements

## üìÅ Recommended File Structure

```
/src
  /components
    /ui (reusable UI components)
    /features (feature-specific components)
  /hooks (custom React hooks)
  /utils (utilities and helpers)
  /types (TypeScript definitions)
  /constants
/tests
  /components
  /utils
  /integration
/.github/workflows
```

## üéØ Current Status

**‚úÖ MAJOR WINS:**

- Testing infrastructure with 20 passing tests
- ESLint + Prettier code quality tools
- Complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Security scanning and dependency checks (fixed and working)
- Post-deployment validation workflow
- **SECURITY UPDATES:**
  - Next.js updated to 15.3.3 (resolves critical vulnerabilities)
  - Fixed GitHub Actions security workflows
  - Dependency vulnerabilities patched

**üîÑ NEXT PRIORITIES:**

1. Component refactoring and code organization
2. Enhanced error handling and loading states
3. Performance optimizations
4. TypeScript migration planning

**üìä Security Status: ‚úÖ SECURE**

- Critical Next.js vulnerabilities resolved
- Dependency scanning active and non-blocking
- Secret scanning configured properly
- All workflows passing
