      <h1>About this site</h1>
        <h3>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h3>
          <p>My name is <a href="https://elezea.com">Rian van der Merwe</a> and this site started as a side project about the music I listen to, but then I got obsessed with it and now it's a whole lot more. It pulls data from <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/bordesak">my Last.fm activity</a> and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/elezea-records/collection">Discogs collection</a>,  and then I âœ¨enhanceâœ¨ the data using APIs from Spotify, <a href="https://odesli.co/">Songlink/Odesli</a>, ChatGPT, and Perplexity. So have fun. Use the site to find information about an artist or album, and find your next favorite listen.</p>
          <p>The site is built on <a href="https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> products, including <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Pages</a>, <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Workers</a>, and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/workers-kv/">Workers KV</a>.  It's a wonderful set of tools to work withâ€”and I'm not just saying that because <a href="https://elezea.com/portfolio/">I work there</a>.</p>
          <p>If you want to chat about this project, feel free to <a href="https://elezea.com/contact/">reach out</a>! And if you spot any bugs (there are lots!) or have any ideas for things to add, please <a href="https://github.com/rianvdm/my-music-next/issues">submit an issue on GitHub</a></p>
